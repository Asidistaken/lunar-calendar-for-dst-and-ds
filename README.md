# Lunar Calendar for Don't Starve Together and Don't Starve
> This repository includes a Lunar Cycle Calendar for both Don't Starve Together and Don't Starve.
- This calendar is designed to help players with Woodie or Wickerbottom on their team. It includes a recalibration feature for situations like Wickerbottom's Lunar Grimoire which changes the current moon phase to a full moon and can change the entire lunar cycle of the game.
- It is designed to help track the Full Moon for events like the Moonstone Event/Chester's changes, or the New Moon for events like the Shadow Shards fight.
